## 2024-05-23 - [Keyboard Accessible File Dropzone]
**Learning:** File upload dropzones that rely solely on `click` events on a container (div) and a hidden file input are inaccessible to keyboard users. Using `display: none` (`className="hidden"`) on the input removes it from the accessibility tree, making it impossible to focus.
**Action:** When creating a custom file upload UI, ensure the container has `tabIndex={0}`, `role="button"`, and an `onKeyDown` handler (Enter/Space) to trigger the hidden input click. Alternatively, keep the file input in the DOM but visually hidden (e.g., `opacity: 0`) and positioned over the container, so it handles focus and activation natively.
